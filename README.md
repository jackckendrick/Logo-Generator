  This project is created for freelance webdevelopers who want to generate simple logos for their projects without having to pay a graphic designer. The goal of the project is to create a command-line application that accepts user input and generates an SVG file with the specified text, color, shape and shape color. The SVG file can be opened in a browser to display a 300x200 pixel image that matches the user's input. 

  ## Installation
  The user must first clone the GitHub repository. Then they must run `npm install` in the command-line to install the dependencies mentioned in the `package.json` file. 
  ## Usage
 The user should run the command `node index.js` in the command-line to start the application. The user must then answer the following questions in the command-line in order to define their specific logo. Then the user can open the newly generated SVG file in the browser to see their logo.
